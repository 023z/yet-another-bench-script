# Yet-Another-Bench-Script

Here's an attempt to create _yet another_ damn Linux server *bench*marking _script_.

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

Luckily, this script isn't an attempt to be a golden standard. It's just yet another bench script to add to your arsenal. Included are several tests that I think are most beneficial for the end-user. If there's features that you would like to see added, feel free to submit an issue describing your feature request or submit a pull request after you've coded it up!

## How to Run

`rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`

## Tests Conducted

* **Test Type 1** - lorem ipsum
* **Test Type 2** - blah blah blah

## Example Output

```
Todo
```
